# Database tables

Tables are created when installing the universe (game/install.php).

Before working with the database, the following MySQL spells must be performed:

```php
    dbquery("SET NAMES 'utf8';");
    dbquery("SET CHARACTER SET 'utf8';");
    dbquery("SET SESSION collation_connection = 'utf8_general_ci';");
```

What they mean you can google more or ask Ð¡hatGPT, but in general they are needed to customize the encoding of string variables (use the universal encoding utf8). All the rest of the game is also sharpened for utf8.

## Table prefix

A prefix is added to all tables from the config.php configuration file - $db_prefix. This is done for convenience in case there will be tables of several universes in one database.

## What to do if you want to change the format of tables

All web developers know that changing database tables is a pain in the ass. In general, it is quite painful to cut "alive", especially for such a developed project.

Procedure:
- Make all necessary modifications to columns and types in the install_tabs.php script
- Add the initial setting of autoincrements in install.php
- Add LOCK tables in db.php (LockTables)
- If it is not supposed to be a clean reinstallation of the Universe, then you need to tweak the columns on the live database (ALTER TABLE + ADD COLUMN) using phpMyAdmin or another similar tool. It is highly recommended to pause the Universe (freeze=1).

## How often do the tables change?

Well.. the project is developing more or less smoothly now. We want to do a little refactoring, so get ready for a little shuffling of tables.

After that, it is unlikely that there will be significant perturbations, because all mechanics and features of version 0.84 are practically implemented.

## Are the tables similar to the tables from the original game?

No 0.84 source code was leaked, so it's hard to say how similar the tables are to what's in the original game.

But just for the most part it all looks like a black box, so there's not much difference. For example, if a planet has a name and G:S:P coordinates, they are obviously stored in the corresponding columns of the "planets" table. And everything else will be similar.

In other words - there is no reason to worry that the tables are organized a bit "unoriginal". It doesn't make sense from the client side anyway, the main thing is that all the game mechanics are respected.
